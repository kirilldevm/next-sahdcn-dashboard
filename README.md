# ShadCN Dashboard

This app is a dashboard for a fictional company. It uses the following ShadCN features:

- Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide Icons for icons
- React Hook Form for form handling
- React Table Library for table handling
- Next Themes for theming
- Radix UI for UI components
- Zod for state management
- Vercel for building and deploying the app

This app is designed to be a simple example of how to use ShadCN features to build a dashboard. It includes a navigation menu, a table, and a form. The app is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
